# SecureAudit: FHE-based Secure Auditing

SecureAudit is a privacy-preserving auditing tool that leverages Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology. By enabling encrypted code uploads and performing homomorphic vulnerability scanning, SecureAudit empowers developers to identify security loopholes while safeguarding intellectual property (IP) from exposure.

## The Problem

In today’s digital landscape, third-party code audits are becoming increasingly vital to maintain the security of applications. However, the traditional auditing process requires exposing cleartext data that can potentially risk the confidentiality of sensitive information, including proprietary algorithms and business logic. The need for privacy in auditing processes is paramount, as revealing such data can lead to exploitation and intellectual property theft.

## The Zama FHE Solution

Fully Homomorphic Encryption offers a groundbreaking approach to address privacy concerns during the auditing process. With FHE, computations can be performed on encrypted data without ever needing to decrypt it. This means that sensitive code remains confidential while still allowing for detailed vulnerability scanning and assessment.

Using Zama's fhevm, SecureAudit processes encrypted inputs, enabling safe auditing practices that protect both the integrity of the code and the privacy of sensitive information. Thanks to FHE, developers can conduct thorough audits without compromising their intellectual property.

## Key Features

- 🔒 **Privacy-First Auditing**: Ensures that sensitive code remains encrypted throughout the audit process.
- 🤖 **Homomorphic Vulnerability Scanning**: Automatically scans for vulnerabilities in encrypted code without revealing its contents.
- 🛡️ **Code Encryption**: Securely encrypts code using Zama's FHE solutions to protect intellectual property.
- 📊 **Detailed Reporting**: Generates comprehensive reports highlighting potential vulnerabilities without exposing any underlying code.
- ⚙️ **Streamlined Workflow**: Simplifies the audit process with easy-to-use interfaces and tools for secure code submission.

## Technical Architecture & Stack

SecureAudit is built with a robust technology stack that leverages the best of Zama's capabilities:

- **Core Privacy Engine**: Zama FHE (fhevm)
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, React
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Security**: TFHE-rs for high-performance homomorphic encryption

## Smart Contract / Core Logic

Below is a simplified pseudocode snippet illustrating how SecureAudit utilizes Zama’s FHE capabilities in the auditing process:solidity
// Solidity code snippet for SecureAudit
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "path/to/TFHE.sol";

contract SecureAudit {
    function auditCode(encryptedCode) public view returns (auditReport) {
        // Decrypt the code using TFHE
        decryptedCode = TFHE.decrypt(encryptedCode);
        
        // Scan for vulnerabilities in the decrypted code
        auditReport = performVulnerabilityScan(decryptedCode);
        
        // Return the detailed audit report
        return auditReport;
    }
}
